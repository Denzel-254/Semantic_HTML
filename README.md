# 🌐 Semantic_HTML
This project demonstrates the use of Semantic HTML to build well-structured, accessible, and SEO-friendly web pages. Semantic HTML uses elements that clearly describe their meaning and role in the document (e.g., &lt;header>, &lt;main>, &lt;article>, &lt;section>, &lt;footer>), making content easier for browsers, screen readers, and search engines to understand.

## Why Semantic HTML Matters

* 🔍 SEO Benefits: Search engines understand context and rank content more effectively.

* 👩‍💻 Readability: Code is easier to read and maintain for developers.

* 📐 Best Practices: Encourages structured, standards-based development.
