# Semantic_HTML
This project demonstrates the use of Semantic HTML to build well-structured, accessible, and SEO-friendly web pages. Semantic HTML uses elements that clearly describe their meaning and role in the document (e.g., &lt;header>, &lt;main>, &lt;article>, &lt;section>, &lt;footer>), making content easier for browsers, screen readers, and search engines to understand.
